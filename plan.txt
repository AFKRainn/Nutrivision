# Project Plan: NutriVision

## Project Overview
NutriVision is a smart cooking assistant integrated into Telegram. It uses AI to identify ingredients from images and suggests recipes based on available inventory and user dietary goals.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Telegram Bot API
- **Computer Vision:** YOLOv12 (for ingredient detection)
- **Large Language Model:** LLaMA or GPT (for recipe generation and NLP)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI/Flask)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL/MongoDB (for user profiles, inventory, and history)
- **External APIs:** OpenFoodFacts (for nutritional data)

## System Architecture
1. **User Interface:** Telegram Bot for image upload and interaction.
2. **Vision Layer:** YOLOv12 model processes images to extract ingredient lists.
3. **Logic Layer:** 
   - Inventory management and manual correction.
   - User profile management (dietary goals, history).
4. **AI Layer:** LLM generates 3 meal suggestions with descriptions and calories.
5. **Data Layer:** Persistent storage for inventory, meal logs, and user settings.

## Development Plan
1. **Phase 1: Setup & Vision**
   - Train/Fine-tune YOLOv12 on food ingredients.
   - Implement image processing pipeline.
2. **Phase 2: Telegram Bot & Backend**
   - Develop the Telegram bot interface.
   - Set up the backend server and database.
3. **Phase 3: LLM Integration**
   - Integrate LLaMA/GPT for recipe generation.
   - Connect to OpenFoodFacts for nutritional data.
4. **Phase 4: Inventory & History**
   - Implement inventory tracking and meal logging logic.
5. **Phase 5: Testing & Refinement**
   - User testing and model optimization.
